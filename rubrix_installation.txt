install docker
run docker in desktop app

then retried with rubrix installation
pip3 install -U "rubrix[server]" --user 
-- user flag because of missing permissions

had to update pip because of problems with httpcore and starlette
python3 -m pip3 install --upgrade --pip3

had to add right version to path
echo "$PATH"
export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin:$PATH 

reran installatin and got warning about path:
export PATH=/Users/maxine/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH

execution works: 
python3 -m rubrix
